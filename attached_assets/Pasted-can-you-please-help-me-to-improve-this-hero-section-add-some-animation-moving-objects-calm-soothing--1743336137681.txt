I'll help you improve the hero section with animations and fix the layout issue where results are displayed on the side on wide screens. Let's create a hero component with smooth animations and ensure the results display properly.

First, I'll create a Hero component:

client/src/components/Hero.tsx
+91
-123
Create Hero component with animations
Now, let's update the Home page to use this Hero component and fix the layout issue:

client/src/pages/Home.tsx

I'll continue improving the hero section with animations for your Logos Argument Analyzer application. Based on the screenshot you shared, I can see you need to make the results display better on wide screens and add some smooth animations to the hero section.

Let me check what files we need to modify to implement these improvements:

client/src/components/Hero.tsx
+87
-0
client/src/pages/Home.tsx
+35
-0
client/src/components/ResultsDisplay.tsx
+212
-192

Dependencies


Installed
framer-motion
Let me explain the changes:

I've created a dedicated Hero component with smooth animations using framer-motion:

Added floating background elements that move gently
Added fade-in and slide-up animations for the logo, heading, and CTA button
Used a clean, minimalist design that matches the application's aesthetic
Updated the Home page layout:

Added the Hero component at the top
Fixed the responsive grid layout to properly display content in columns on wider screens
Added an ID for the analyze section so the "Start Analyzing" button can scroll to it
Updated the ResultsDisplay component:

Improved the header layout to stack elements vertically on mobile and horizontally on larger screens
Added proper spacing and overflow handling
These changes will make your application look more professional with soothing animations in the hero section while ensuring the content displays properly on wide screens.

I can see the issue. Looking at the error message, there's a duplicate declaration of the Home component in the client/src/pages/Home.tsx file. Let's fix this issue first to get your app running again.

client/src/pages/Home.tsx
+72
-122
Now, let's also make sure the Hero component works well with animations and looks good on wide screens:

client/src/components/Hero.tsx
+125
-71

npm run dev
